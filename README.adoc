= SUSE Documentation Style Guide

This style guide provides answers to common writing, style and layout questions
for SUSE documentation. The guide now offers two fully maintained 
versions: one for DocBook XML and one for AsciiDoc. While both guides address the 
same core questions about voice, terminology, structure and layout, each applies 
specific rules to its format.

Select your format and follow the conventions to make your content 
clearer for readers, easier for translators, and smoother for contributors.

The two versions of the Style Guide are published at 
https://documentation.suse.com/style/current/[doc.suse.com/style].
