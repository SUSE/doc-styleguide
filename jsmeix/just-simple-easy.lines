 141	:    <para>Being quite an <quote>old-timer,</quote> Ext2 underwent many improvements and was heavily tested. This might be the reason why people often refer to it as rock-solid. After a system outage when the file system could not be cleanly unmounted, e2fsck starts to analyze the file system data. Metadata is brought into a consistent state and pending files or data blocks are written to a designated directory (called <filename>lost+found</filename>). In contrast to journaling file systems, e2fsck analyzes the entire file system and not just the recently modified bits of metadata. This takes significantly longer than checking the log data of a journaling file system. Depending on file system size, this procedure can take half an hour or more. Therefore, it is not desirable to choose Ext2 for any server that needs high availability. However, because Ext2 does not maintain a journal and uses significantly less memory, it is sometimes faster than other file systems.</para>
 144	:    <title>Easy Upgradability</title>
 145	:    <para>Because Ext3 is based on the Ext2 code and shares its on-disk format as well as its metadata format, upgrades from Ext2 to Ext3 are very easy. </para>
 150	:   <para>Ext3 was designed by Stephen Tweedie. Unlike all other next-generation file systems, Ext3 does not follow a completely new design principle. It is based on Ext2. These two file systems are very closely related to each other. An Ext3 file system can be easily built on top of an Ext2 file system. The most important difference between Ext2 and Ext3 is that Ext3 supports journaling. In summary, Ext3 has three major advantages to offer: </para>
 163	:    <title>Easy and Highly Reliable Upgrades from Ext2</title>
 164	:    <para>The code for Ext2 is the strong foundation on which Ext3 could become a highly-acclaimed next-generation file system. Its reliability and solidity are elegantly combined in Ext3 with the advantages of a journaling file system. Unlike transitions to other journaling file systems, such as ReiserFS or XFS, which can be quite tedious (making backups of the entire file system and recreating it from scratch), a transition to Ext3 is a matter of minutes. It is also very safe, because re-creating an entire file system from scratch might not work flawlessly. Considering the number of existing Ext2 systems that await an upgrade to a journaling file system, you can easily see why Ext3 might be of some importance to many system administrators. Downgrading from Ext3 to Ext2 is as easy as the upgrade. Just perform a clean unmount of the Ext3 file system and remount it as an Ext2 file system. </para>
 203	:   <para>Every node in an OCFS2 setup has concurrent read and write access to all data. This requires OCFS2 to be cluster-aware, meaning that OCFS2 must include a means to determine which nodes are in the cluster and whether these nodes are actually alive and available. To compute a cluster’s membership, OCFS2 includes a node manager. To monitor the availability of the nodes in a cluster, OCFS2 includes a simple heartbeat implementation. To avoid problems arising from various nodes directly accessing the file system, OCFS2 also contains a distributed lock manager. Communication between the nodes is handled via a TCP-based messaging system. </para>
 243	:    <para>In ReiserFS, all data is organized in a structure called a B*-balanced tree. The tree structure contributes to better disk space utilization because small files can be stored directly in the B* tree leaf nodes instead of being stored elsewhere and just maintaining a pointer to the actual disk location. In addition to that, storage is not allocated in chunks of 1 or 4 KB, but in portions of the exact size needed. Another benefit lies in the dynamic allocation of inodes. This keeps the file system more flexible than traditional file systems, like Ext2, where the inode density must be specified at file system creation time. </para>
 776	:    <para>It is possible to activate a <emphasis>striping mode</emphasis> that distributes the data stream of a logical volume over several physical volumes.

3849	:   <para>Level&nbsp;4 provides block-level striping just like Level&nbsp;0 combined with a dedicated parity disk. If a data disk fails, the parity data is used to create a replacement disk. However, the parity disk might create a bottleneck for write access. Nevertheless, Level&nbsp;4 is sometimes used. </para>
4891	:  <para>To create a degraded array in which some devices are missing, simply give the word <literal>missing</literal> in place of a device name. This causes <command>mdadm</command> to leave the corresponding slot in the array empty. </para>
