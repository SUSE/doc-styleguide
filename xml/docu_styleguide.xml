  <abstract>
    <para>This guide provides answers to writing, style, and layout questions
      commonly arising when editing SUSE or openSUSE documentation. The
      NovDoc/DocBook markup reference at the end of this guide will help you
      choose the right XML tag for your purpose. Following this guide will
      make your documentation more understandable and easier to translate.

  <sect1 id="sec.audience">
    <title>Audience</title>

    <para>Before starting to write, define the target audience of your
      documentation. Adjust tone, style, and technicality of the text based on
      the intended audience. Keep in mind that not all facts that seem
      obvious to you will be obvious to your readers. If you move parts of
      documents into other documents, make sure to adapt the parts you
      move to the new document.
    </para>
    <para>For later reference, document the defined target audience in the
      main file of every book and article. Place an XML comment directly
      before the relevant <sgmltag>book</sgmltag> or
      <sgmltag>article</sgmltag> tag, such as this:
    </para>
    <screen>&lt;!-- Target audience: institutional desktop users. --&gt;</screen>
    <para>For more information about the usage of XML comments, see
      <xref linkend="sec.xmlcomment"/>. In many cases, there is no need to
      also add information about the target audience to the book or
      article text itself.

  <sect1 id="sec.outline">
    <title>Outline of a Manual</title>

    <para>Maintain a consistent structure within your documents. The structure
      can vary between different books or projects, but the most common type
      is documented here.
    </para>
    <para>Manuals should always contain five elements: title page,
      copyright notice, table of contents, preface, and chapters which are
      split in sections. Optionally, use parts, appendixes, a glossary, and
      an index. Descriptions and usage instructions for these elements are
      provided below.

          <para>The imprint on the second page lists edition, copyright
            notice, and the names of contributors. Add the names of all
            authors and contributors to a separate file

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Parts</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Parts add an additional element of structure to manuals with
            many chapters to improve the usability of a book. Keep part titles
            clear and concise. Often a single noun is enough. Typical part
            titles include <emphasis>Installation</emphasis> or
            <emphasis>Network</emphasis>.

                  <para>Abstracts summarize the information provided in a
                    chapter in five or fewer sentences. Rather than writing
                    about what the chapter does,
                    summarize the information the chapter contains. This gives
                    readers an idea of what they can learn from the
                    chapter.

                    file systems, including Btrfs, Ext3, Ext4, from
                    which you can choose at installation time. Each file system
                    has advantages and disadvantages that make it more or less
                    suitable for a scenario. Professional high-performance
                    setups can require a different choice of file system than
                    a home user setup.

                  helpful, split sections into subsections, but avoid going

                brief sketch. For less experienced readers, steps of
                the procedure could contain a (usually clickable) reference
                to a subsection where the necessary background is provided

    <title>Language</title>

    <para>The following rules are intentionally kept concise.
      When in doubt about a style rule, refer to
      <citetitle>The Chicago Manual of Style</citetitle>, 15th
      Edition. When in doubt about the spelling or usage of a word, first refer
      to <xref linkend="app.terminology"/>. When the usage of a word is not
      regulated there, use American English spellings as defined on
      <ulink url="http://www.merriam-webster.com/"/>
      (<ulink url="http://www.m-w.com/"/> for short).
    </para>
    <para>If a product you are documenting is not listed in the terminology
      table, refer to the SUSE home page, <ulink url="http://www.suse.com"/>.
      If the product is not mentioned on the SUSE home page, refer to the
      Marketing department.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="sec.abbreviation">
      <title>Abbreviations</title>

      <para>Do not use any abbreviations, except <emphasis>etc.</emphasis> or
        abbreviations of common units of measurement. Do not create
        a plural of these abbreviations by adding an <quote>s.</quote> Use a
        non-breaking (<sgmltag>&amp;nbsp;</sgmltag>) space between
        the numeral and corresponding unit abbreviation.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="sec.acronym">
      <title>Acronyms</title>
      <para>A title must not contain both an acronym and its expansion. When
        dealing with a term that is commonly written as an acronym, use the
        acronym in the title. When mentioning the term for the first time in
        the following text, use its expanded form. All following occurrences
        of the term in this chapter should then use the acronym.
      </para>
      <para>Because sometimes chapters and parts are used across multiple
        documents, it is important to provide the expansion of an acronym at
        least once per chapter. Be consistent in how you provide the
        expansion. If you use the acronym followed by the written out form
        in one chapter, do this in all other chapters too.
      </para>
      <para>Create plural forms of acronyms by adding a lowercase
        <quote>s,</quote> for example, <quote>CDs</quote> and
        <quote>BIOSs.</quote> Avoid using possessive forms of acronyms
        (a negative example would be <quote>XMLʼs specification</quote>)
        for reasons of clarity.

    <sect2 id="sec.capitalization">
      <title>Capitalization and Title Style</title>

      <para>In all running text, use sentence-style capitalization, that is,
        only capitalize the first word of a sentence and proper names.
      </para>
      <para>Use title-style capitalization for all types of headings and titles,
        including figure and table titles. This style is explained in
        <citetitle>The Chicago Manual of Style</citetitle> 8.167.
        A simplified version of these rules is below:

        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>In variable lists, capitalize the term in title style unless it
        is a complete sentence. In all list items, use sentence-style
        capitalization (capitalize the first letter and proper nouns only).
        Use title style for row and column labels in tables.
      </para>

    <sect2 id="sec.comma">
      <title>Commas</title>

      <para>Use commas between all items in a series of three or more elements
        (<quote>Oxford commas</quote>). For example, write <quote>a, b,
        and c.</quote> Use commas around phrases like <emphasis>for
        example</emphasis> and <emphasis>that is</emphasis>. Introductory
        phrases at the beginning of a sentence are normally followed by a comma.
        For example, <quote>Before using YaST Online Update, configure
        a network connection.</quote>

      <para>Use second person (<quote>you</quote>) to refer to the reader.
        Normally, the reader is the user or administrator that does
        the actions described. Do not overuse <quote>you.</quote> It
        is often understood, especially in directions.
      </para>
      <para>Use active voice. Active voice means that the subject of the
        sentence performs the verb. For example, <quote>The root user
        performs administrative tasks</quote> is active voice.
        <quote>Administrative tasks are performed by the root user</quote>
        is passive voice. Passive voice can be used occasionally if
        there is a need to place emphasis on the object of the verb or
        if the doer of the action is unknown. <quote>A SAMBA server
        must be configured in the network</quote> is an example of
        proper use of passive voice. The emphasis is on the server,
        not on the person configuring it.

    SUSE uses four different kinds of admonitory and advisory paragraphs.
    These elements are formatted in a way to draw the attention of the reader.
    Therefore, limit their use as much and avoid using more than one per
    PDF output page.

            <para>
       These elements warn of security issues, potential loss of data,
       damage to equipment (hardware), or physical hazards to the user. A
       warning must always precede the action to which it applies. A typical
       example is:
      </para>
            <example>
              <title>A Typical Example of a Warning</title>
              <screen>&lt;warning&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Creating File Systems&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;para&gt;
    Formatting can take up to several hours depending
    on the partition size. Do not try to interrupt
    this process. This could result in a corrupted file
    system that renders the installation
    unusable. Proceed with the installation after
    formatting has been completed.
  &lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/warning&gt;</screen>
            </example>
            <para>
       A warning consists of the warning headline, a title stating the
       action considered dangerous, followed by a descriptive paragraph
       explaining the nature and origin of the danger. Clearly state what
       could happen if the reader ignored the warning. Finally, tell the
       reader how to avoid the dangerous situation.

      <para>To mark up multiple links, use a <sgmltag>itemizedlist</sgmltag>

        If you need to present a large number of links, group them by topic and
        create a separate list environment for each group. Provide a
        comprehensive title for each of the groups or an introductory sentence.
      </para>
      <para>Use the <sgmltag>ulink</sgmltag> tag to mark up URLs that can be
        opened with a web browser, such as <ulink url="http://www.suse.de"/>.
        Always prefix the correct protocol (such as <literal>http://</literal>),
        otherwise the links will not work. Never use <sgmltag>filename</sgmltag>
        for a link, as that would both disable the link checker and make the

      </para>
      <para>Try to make URLs as short as possible before pasting them into your
        documentation. Many long URLs can be shortened by leaving away
        non-essential pieces of them. This is often the case with search URLs
        or URLs of Internet news media. If a web site provides a built-in URL
        shortener, use that. Do not resort to using external URL shorteners, as
        that both hides the actual destination a link will take the user to and
        introduces an extra element of uncertainty, as the shortening service
        may disappear or become unreliable in the future.

      <para>Do not use <sgmltag>ulink</sgmltag> to link to SUSE

     </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
      A list must contain at least two items. If items are short and simple

    The different types can be nested, but avoid nesting too many levels.
    When nesting different types of lists or introducing multiple levels of
    one type, always consider the flow of the text. It is rarely necessary
    to have more than one level in a list. Using too many levels disrupts
    the text flow, confuses readers, and heavily influences the document
    layout. Consider these issues carefully before nesting lists or
    introducing another list level. Restructuring the information using a
    well-balanced combination of lists and flowing texts is a good
    approach.

    Use tables to present a large number of similar facts. A table makes
    them easy to scan and compare when presenting the same information
    textually would require several paragraphs.
   </para>
      <para>
    Always keep tables as simple as possible. They should not require
    extensive explanations in the related text and should make sense even to
    those readers who are not very familiar with the topic.
   </para>
      <para>
    A table always has a title. If you assign an
    <sgmltag class="attribute">id</sgmltag>, it can be identified and
    referenced by this attribute.

    The writer of the remark should start the remark with his or her
    user name followed by a colon (<literal>:</literal>). Others responding to
    the remark should insert their user name, a colon, and comments inside the
    tags but starting on a new line. Comments should be deleted by the original
    writer when they consider the issue resolved. The following is an
    example remark:
   </para>

      <title>XML Comments</title>
      <para>
    XML comments are primarily used for temporarily disabling portions of

    used to point the reader of a remark to the appropriate point in a text.
   </para>

    The final use of comments is to mark changes made for layout reasons.

    <para>Once an entity is defined, it can be used in many places. Entities

    The following provides some background on the most important entities
    used in creating documentation for SUSE products. To be able to adjust
    product names of platform branding even past any deadlines, a set of
    entities must represent the frequently-changing product names. The same
    applies to book titles. An <filename>entity-decl.ent</filename> file
    contains several different categories of entities. These are:
