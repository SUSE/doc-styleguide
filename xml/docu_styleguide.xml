    <title>Structure of SUSE Manuals</title>

    <para>It is important to maintain a consistent structure within a
      document. This structure can vary for different books or projects, but
      the most common type is documented here.
    </para>
    <para>A SUSE manual consists of the following mandatory elements: title page,
      copyright notice, table of contents, preface, and chapters split in
      sections. Optionally, use parts, appendixes, a glossary, and an index.
      Descriptions and usage instructions for these elements are provided below.
    </para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Title Page</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The title page contains the logo, a title, the name of the
            product described, and its version.

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Imprint</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The second page (imprint) lists edition, copyright notice, and
            the names of contributors. Add the names of all authors and
            contributors to the file <filename>authors.xml</filename>.

        <listitem>
          <para>Parts add an additional element of structure to manuals with
            many chapters to improve the usability of a book. Keep part titles
            clear and concise. Often a single noun is enough. Typical part
            titles include <emphasis>Installation</emphasis> or
            <emphasis>Network</emphasis>.

                <para>Abstracts briefly summarize the information provided in
                  a chapter. Rather than writing about what the chapter does,
                  summarize the information the chapter contains. This gives
                  readers a clear idea of what they can learn from the
                  chapter.

                    which you can choose at installation time. Each file system
                    has advantages and disadvantages that make it more or less
                    suitable for a scenario. Professional high-performance
                    setups can require a different choice of file system than
                    a home user setup.

                    the text. Create sections for every major task, such as
                    installing, configuring, monitoring, and administering. If
                    helpful, split sections into subsections, but avoid going
                    above three levels of sections.
                  </para>
                  <para>Sections start with an introductory paragraph outlining
                    the focus of the section. If the section describes a
                    sequential task, follow the introduction with a procedure
                    description, as discussed in <xref linkend="sec.procs"/>.
                    Experienced users familiar with the topic can follow this
                    brief sketch. For less experienced readers, steps of
                    the procedure could contain a (usually clickable) reference
                    to a subsection where the necessary background is provided
                    and the action explained in more detail.

                    Structure the section by using a
                    <sgmltag>variablelist</sgmltag>, in which you name a typical
                    symptom and then a solution. In case you want to describe

 <sect1 id="sec.edrules">
  <title>Writing and Editing</title>

  <para>
   These rules are intentionally kept brief and simple. They contain
   specifics related to SUSE and openSUSE documentation and sometimes
   standard English rules. Where relevant, specific markup is mentioned
   to assist in maintaining consistency in SUSE documentation.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="sec.edrules.abbrev">
   <title>Abbreviations and Acronyms</title>
   <para>
    Do not use any abbreviations, except <emphasis>etc.</emphasis> or
    abbreviations of common units of measurement. Do not create
    a plural of these abbreviations by adding an <quote>s.</quote> Use a
    non-breaking (<sgmltag>&amp;nbsp;</sgmltag>) space between
    the numeral and corresponding unit abbreviation.
   </para>
   <para>
    A title must not contain both an acronym and its expansion. When dealing
    with a term that is commonly written as an acronym, use the acronym in
    the title. When mentioning the term for the first time in the following
    text, use its expanded form. All following occurrences of the term in this
    chapter should then use the acronym.
   </para>
   <para>
    Because sometimes chapters and parts are used across multiple documents,
    it is important to provide the expansion of an acronym at least once per
    chapter. Be consistent in how you provide the expansion. If you use the
    acronym followed by the written out form in one chapter, do this in all
    other chapters too.
   </para>
   <para>
    Create plural forms of acronyms by adding a lowercase <quote>s,</quote>
    for example, <quote>CDs</quote> and <quote>BIOSs.</quote> Avoid using
    possessive forms of acronyms (a negative example would be
    <quote>XML's specification</quote>) for reasons of
    clarity.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 status="ready" id="sec.edrules.address">
   <title>Web Links</title>
   <para>
    SUSE documentation contains <quote>For More Information</quote> sections
    at the end of most chapters to point to further sources of information
    regarding the topic. Whenever possible, links and addresses are grouped
    there and presented by means of a <sgmltag>variablelist</sgmltag>
    environment (link plus explanatory remarks). Do not use a list
    environment for only one link.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you need to present a large number of links, group them by topic and
    create a separate list environment for each group. Provide a
    comprehensive title for each of the groups or an introductory sentence.
   </para>
   <para>
    Translators are normally provided with localized versions of links in
    the comments of the source code. If none is provided, the English
    default is used as fallback.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can provide links or addresses directly in the main sections, but
    are encouraged to use and refer to the <quote>For More
    Information</quote> section wherever possible. Both automated checks and
    the use of editor comments for translators ensure that the links are
    kept up-to-date.
   </para>
   <para>
    For detailed information about external and internal references and
    addresses in SUSE documents, refer to
    <xref linkend="sec.edrules.reference"/>.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 status="ready" id="sec.edrules.admon">
   <title>Admonitory and Advisory Paragraphs</title>
   <para>
    SUSE uses four different kinds of admonitory and advisory paragraphs.
    These elements are formatted in a way to draw the reader's attention.
    Therefore, limit their use as much and avoid using more than one per
    PDF output page.
   </para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><sgmltag>warning</sgmltag>
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       These elements warn of security issues, potential loss of data,
       damage to equipment (hardware), or physical hazards to the user. A
       warning must always precede the action to which it applies. A typical
       example is:
      </para>
      <example>
       <title>A Typical Example of a SUSE Warning</title>
<screen>&lt;warning>
 &lt;title>Creating File Systems&lt;/title>
  &lt;para>
    Formatting can take up to several hours depending
    on the partition size. Do not try to interrupt
    this process. This could result in a corrupted file
    system that renders the installation
    unusable. Proceed with the installation after
    formatting has been completed.
  &lt;/para>
&lt;/warning></screen>
      </example>
      <para>
       A warning consists of the warning headline, a title stating the
       action considered dangerous, followed by a descriptive paragraph
       explaining the nature and origin of the danger. Clearly state what
       could happen if the reader ignored the warning. Finally, tell the
       reader how to avoid the dangerous situation.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><sgmltag>important</sgmltag>
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       These elements introduce vital information that deserves particular
       attention. Similar to the warning element,
       <sgmltag>important</sgmltag> includes a title stating the topic
       covered in the following explanation.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><sgmltag>tip</sgmltag>
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       A <sgmltag>tip</sgmltag> is used to introduce guidelines or tips that
       are helpful to the user. Using an appropriate title is strongly
       recommended.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><sgmltag>note</sgmltag>
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <sgmltag>note</sgmltag> element is useful for emphasizing
       information that differs from previous versions, providing important
       information that does not fit into the paragraph, and pointing out
       architecture-specific information. Using an appropriate title is
       strongly recommended.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
   </variablelist>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.edrules.aud">
   <title>Audience</title>

   <para>It is generally not necessary to describe the intended audience in the
    text, but keep it in mind when writing the document. It may also be helpful
    to document the targeted audience outside of a book, for later reference.
    Adjust tone, style, and technicality of the text based on the intended
    audience. Keep in mind that not everything that is obvious to you is also
    obvious to others.
   </para>
   <para>
    Structure the documentation by relevant tasks instead of providing
    reference documentation by describing each part of the user interface
    individually. For example, when describing YaST, focus on how to configure
    the devices and services the user needs rather than the module structure
    and available dialogs.
   </para>
   <para>
    Focus on the positives: describe what the program can do rather than its
    limitations. Be honest in your documentation and avoid absolutes and the
    exaggerations of marketing language.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.edrules.cap">
   <title>Capitalization</title>
   <para>Use title-style capitalization for all types of headings and titles,
    including figure and table titles. This style is explained in
    <citetitle>Chicago</citetitle> 8.167. A simplified version of these rules
    is below:
   </para>
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>Capitalize the first, the last word and everything that is not
      mentioned in the other four points of this list.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Lowercase articles, that is, <emphasis>the</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>a</emphasis>, and <emphasis>an</emphasis>
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Lowercase prepositions, such as <emphasis>up</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>in</emphasis>, <emphasis>of</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>through</emphasis>, and <emphasis>between</emphasis>, unless
      they are used with a verb, such as <quote>Logging In</quote> or with a
      noun, as in <quote>The On Button</quote>
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Lowercase the following conjunctions: <emphasis>and</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>but</emphasis>, <emphasis>for</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>nor</emphasis>, and <emphasis>or</emphasis>
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Lowercase <emphasis>as</emphasis> and <emphasis>to</emphasis></para>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
   <para>In variable lists, capitalize the term in title style unless it is a
    complete sentence. In all list items, use sentence-style capitalization
    (capitalize the first letter and proper nouns only). Use title style for
    row and column labels in tables.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.edrules.contract">
   <title>Contractions</title>
   <para>Do not use contractions, unless you are purposefully writing a casual
    document.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.edrules.reference">
   <title>Cross-References and References to External Resources</title>
   <para>
    Use <sgmltag>xref</sgmltag> when you refer to an appendix, chapter,
    part, preface, section, table, figure, or example. The referenced
    element needs an <sgmltag class="attribute">id</sgmltag> attribute. When
    referencing these elements, do not insert a text label like
    <quote>appendix</quote>, <quote>chapter</quote>, <quote>part</quote>,
    <quote>preface</quote>, <quote>section</quote>, <quote>table</quote>,
    <quote>figure</quote>, and <quote>example</quote>. These are inserted
    automatically.
   </para>
   <para>
    Do not insert a reference to a paragraph (<sgmltag>para</sgmltag>). If
    you need a reference to a list, insert <sgmltag>id</sgmltag> and
    <sgmltag>xreflabel</sgmltag>.
   </para>
   <para>
    References to man pages and info pages should generally be made in the
    format <quote>the man page of <command>command</command></quote> or
    <quote>the info page of <command>command</command></quote>. In a
    situation where the category of the page is needed, add
    <quote>(<command>man 9 command</command>)</quote> to the end.
   </para>
   <para>Use the <sgmltag>ulink</sgmltag> tag to mark up URLs, such as
    <ulink url="http://www.suse.de"/>. Always prefix the correct protocol
    (<literal>http://</literal>, <literal>ftp://</literal>,
    <literal>mailto://</literal>) to enable automated link checks. Never
    use <sgmltag>filename</sgmltag> for a link, as that would disable the link
    checker and make the link unclickable. Do not enter a text label for the
    <sgmltag>ulink</sgmltag> so that the URL itself appears in printed versions.
   </para>
   <para>To reference file names, always use the <sgmltag>filename</sgmltag>
    tag. Never include the <literal>file://</literal> prefix.
   </para>
   <para>
    Do not use links across documents where ID and IDREF linking is not

    It is useful to provide language-specific references in the translated
    books. If the authors know of language-specific versions, they can
    include them in comments for translators. As time permits,
    translators should look for corresponding language-specific resources.
    For URLs, provide only the language-specific version of a site. Use the
    English as a fallback. For books, provide the title of the translated
    version along with the original title if such a translation exists.

   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      List environments should be used cautiously. Their markup is quite
      distinct and overusing them might disrupt the text flow.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Always introduce a list in the text. If needed for reference or better
      coordination with the related text, add an optional title and an
      <sgmltag class="attribute">id</sgmltag> attribute.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A list must contain at least two items. If items are short and simple
      in structure, consider incorporating them in the flowing text instead
      of creating a list environment.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Use sentence-style capitalization for the list items. Use title-style
      capitalization for terms in descriptive lists.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      If using multiple sentences as a list item, end all items in that list
      with a period.

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Make sure that the items are grammatically parallel constructions

     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    The different types can be nested, but avoid nesting too many levels.
    When nesting different types of lists or introducing multiple levels of
    one type, always consider the flow of the text. It is rarely necessary
    to have more than one level in a list. Using too many levels disrupts
    the text flow, confuses readers, and heavily influences the document
    layout. Consider these issues carefully before nesting lists or
    introducing another list level. Restructuring the information using a
    well-balanced combination of lists and flowing texts is a good
    approach.

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     An optional title. If you need to reference the procedure as a whole,
     set an <sgmltag

     used as the label of the reference.
    </para>

  <title>Creating an Index</title>

  <para>
   An index is an important part of a book, especially when printing. Index
   terms should be used to provide the reader with access to useful information.
   Insert the term as close to the relevant text as possible to ensure that the
   page reference points to the correct location. When more than a few
   paragraphs contain information that should be indexed under this term,
   use a page range. Page ranges help users determine how much information a
   given section provides on a certain topic. Nest index terms up to
   two levels deep.
  </para>

  <para>
   When indexing, try to answer the question: Is a user likely to be looking
   for this information? For example, a section about
   configuring an application should be indexed to the application, but a
   passing reference to the application should not be indexed at all.
  </para>

  <para>Some parts of a document should never be indexed, those include
   <quote>For More Information</quote> sections, abstracts, or commands that
   only appear as means to a different end (as in, do not index
   <command>cd</command> when it is only used to change directories as part of
   a procedure).
  </para>

  <para>
   Be careful with consistently selecting the terms to index. However, consider
   that users might not have the exact same terms in mind as you do, especially
   when it comes to highly technical words or brands. Write nouns in the plural
   and verbs in a gerund form (<emphasis>-ing</emphasis>).
   Capitalize terms only if they would be capitalized if used in the middle of
   a sentence.
  </para>

  <para>
   When selecting terms, try to consider what else is included in the
   manual. If the manual only includes a small amount of information on a given
   topic, general index items are probably more appropriate. If indexing a
   chapter about an application, much more specific index terms are needed
   so that users can find exactly the information they need.
  </para>

   Finally, a few tips to help <quote>polish</quote> indexes:

  <title>Spelling and Terminology</title>

  <para>
    For all words not specially defined below, SUSE uses American English
    spellings as defined below in <citetitle>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate
    Dictionary, Eleventh Edition</citetitle> or the accompanying web site
    <ulink url="http://www.m-w.com/"/>. However,
    in case of a doubt, the primary spelling in the printed dictionary is
    considered authoritative.

  <title>Terminology</title>

  <para>
    Because multiple spellings of a variety of words and terms are in common
    usage, we have standardized on a variant to use in our documentation.
    Terms in this table are capitalized as they would be in the middle of a
    sentence. Some words listed here are provided because they are often
    written incorrectly by non-native speakers.
  </para>
  <para>Note that only some of the most important SUSE products are listed here.

        <remark>This strays from Novell's Style Guide but the difference
          between Novell's meaning for "enter" (= type something, then press
          Enter) and Novell's meaning for "type" (= type something, don't press
          Enter) is so small from a user's point of view that it doesn't make
          sense to keep the second verb around. -- sknorr, 2013-09-18

    The writer of the remark should start the remark with his or her

    the remark should insert their user name, a colon, and comments inside the
    tags but starting on a new line. Comments should be deleted by the original
    writer when they consider the issue resolved. The following is an
    example remark:
