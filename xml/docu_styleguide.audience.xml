 <para>
  Before starting to write, define the target audience of your
  documentation. Adjust tone, style, and technicality of the text based on
  the intended audience. Keep in mind that not all facts that seem obvious
  to you will be obvious to your readers. If you move parts of documents
  into other documents, make sure to adapt the parts you move to the new
  document.
 </para>

 <para>
  For later reference, document the defined target audience in the main file
  of every book and article. Place an XML comment directly before the
  relevant
  <tag class="emptytag">book</tag>
  or
  <tag class="emptytag">article</tag>
  element, such as this:

 <para>
  Generally, there is no need to add information about the target audience
  to the book or article content itself.
