    <title>Audience</title>

    <para>Before starting to write, define the target audience of your
      documentation. Adjust tone, style, and technicality of the text based on
      the intended audience. Keep in mind that not all facts that seem
      obvious to you will be obvious to your readers. If you move parts of
      documents into other documents, make sure to adapt the parts you
      move to the new document.
    </para>
    <para>For later reference, document the defined target audience in the
      main file of every book and article. Place an XML comment directly
      before the relevant <sgmltag class="emptytag">book</sgmltag> or
      <sgmltag class="emptytag">article</sgmltag> element, such as this:
    </para>
    <screen>&lt;!-- Target audience: institutional desktop users. --&gt;</screen>
    <para>For more information about the usage of XML comments, see
      <xref linkend="sec.xmlcomment"/>. In many cases, there is no need to
      also add information about the target audience to the book or
      article text itself.
