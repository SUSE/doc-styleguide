  <title>Creating a Consistent Structure</title>

  <para>
   It is important to maintain a relatively consistent structure within a
   document. This structure may vary for different books or projects. For

           openSUSE 10.2 ships with a number of different file systems,
           including ReiserFS, Ext2, Ext3, and XFS, from which to choose at
           installation time. Each file system has its own advantages and
           disadvantages that can make it more suited to a scenario.

          Create sections in analogy to the main tasks, like installing,
          configuring, monitoring, and administering. If helpful, split
          sections into subsections. Sections start with an introductory
          paragraph outlining the focus of the section. If the section works
          with a sequential task, you can follow this introduction with a
          procedure description, as discussed in
          <xref
           linkend="sec.procs"/>, which clearly states all
          the necessary steps to accomplish a task. Experienced users
          familiar with the topic can follow this brief sketch. For less
          experienced readers, each step of the procedure can contain a link
          to a subsection where the necessary background is provided and the
          action explained in more detail. In HTML and PDF online
          documentation, these links are clickable, providing easy access to

  <title>Writing and Editing</title>

  <para>
   These rules are intentionally kept brief and simple. They contain
   specifics related to SUSE and openSUSE documentation and sometimes
   standard English rules. Where relevant, specific markup may be mentioned
   to assist in maintaining consistency in SUSE documentation.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="sec.edrules.abbrev">
   <title>Abbreviations and Acronyms</title>
   <para>
    Most abbreviations may not be used. <quote>etc.</quote> may be used in
    parentheses and some rare instances, but not in combination with phrases
    like <quote>for example</quote> or <quote>such as.</quote> It should be
    followed by a comma.
   </para>
   <para>
    Abbreviations of common units of measure may also be used. Do not create
    a plural of these abbreviations by adding an <quote>s.</quote> Use a
    non-breaking (<sgmltag class="genentity">nbsp</sgmltag>) space between
    the numeral and multiple-letter abbreviations. Do not use a space before
    single-letter abbreviations.
   </para>
   <para>
    A header must not contain both the acronym and the meaning. Common
    acronyms can be used in the header and written out in the following
    text.
   </para>
   <para>
    Once the acronym has been presented in the written out form, use the
    acronym version in the rest of a chapter. Because sometimes chapters and
    parts are used in different documents, it is important to map acronym
    and meaning at least once per chapter. Be consistent with this mapping.
    If you use the acronym followed by the written out form in one chapter,
    try to do this in all others.
   </para>
   <para>
    Form plural forms of acronyms by adding a lowercase <quote>s,</quote>
    for example, <quote>CDs</quote> and <quote>BIOSs.</quote> Because some
    rare acronyms create plurals by adding <quote>'s,</quote> avoid using
    possessive forms of acronyms for reasons of clarity.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 status="ready" id="sec.edrules.address">
   <title>Addresses</title>
   <para>
    SUSE documentation contains <quote>For More Information</quote> sections
    at the end of most chapters to point to further sources of information
    regarding the topic. Whenever possible, links and addresses are grouped
    there and presented by means of a <sgmltag>variablelist</sgmltag>
    environment (link plus explanatory remarks). Do not use a list
    environment for only one link.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you need to present a large number of links, group them by topic and
    create a separate list environment for each group. Provide a
    comprehensive title for each of the groups or an introductory sentence.
   </para>
   <para>
    Translators are normally provided with localized versions of links in
    the comments of the source code. If none is provided, the English
    default is used as fallback.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can provide links or addresses directly in the main sections, but
    are encouraged to use and refer to the <quote>For More
    Information</quote> section wherever possible. Both automated checks and
    the use of editor comments for translators ensure that the links are
    kept up-to-date.
   </para>
   <para>
    For detailed information about external and internal references and
    addresses in SUSE documents, refer to
    <xref linkend="sec.edrules.reference"/>.

  </sect2>

  <sect2 status="ready" id="sec.edrules.admon">
   <title>Admonitory and Advisory Paragraphs</title>
   <para>
    SUSE uses four different kinds of admonitory and advisory paragraphs.
    Because these elements are formatted in a way to draw the reader's
    attention to them, their use should be limited to specific situations.
    Additionally, avoid using more than one per page.
   </para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><sgmltag>warning</sgmltag>
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       These elements warn of security issues, potential loss of data,
       damage to equipment (hardware), or physical hazards to the user. A
       warning must always precede the action to which it applies. A typical
       example of a warning used in SUSE documentation is:
      </para>
      <example>
       <title>A Typical Example of a SUSE Warning</title>
<screen>&lt;warning>
 &lt;title>Creating File Systems&lt;/title>
  &lt;para>
    Formatting may take up to several hours depending
    on the partition size. Do not try to interrupt
    this process. This could result in a corrupted file
    system that renders the installation
    unusable. Proceed with the installation after
    formatting has been completed.
  &lt;/para>
&lt;/warning></screen>
      </example>
      <para>
       A warning consists of the warning headline, a title stating the
       action considered dangerous, followed by a descriptive paragraph
       explaining the nature and origin of the danger. Clearly state what
       could happen if the reader ignored the warning. Finally, tell the
       reader how to avoid the dangerous situation.

     <term><sgmltag>important</sgmltag>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       These elements introduce vital information that deserves particular
       attention. Similar to the warning element,
       <sgmltag>important</sgmltag> includes a title stating the topic
       covered in the following explanation.

    <varlistentry>
     <term><sgmltag>tip</sgmltag>
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       A <sgmltag>tip</sgmltag> is used to introduce guidelines or tips that
       are helpful to the user. Using an appropriate title is strongly
       recommended.
      </para>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><sgmltag>note</sgmltag>
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <sgmltag>note</sgmltag> element is useful for emphasizing
       information that differs from previous versions, providing important
       information that does not fit into the paragraph, and pointing out
       architecture-specific information. Using an appropriate title is
       strongly recommended.

   </variablelist>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.edrules.aud">
   <title>Audience</title>
   <para>
    It is generally not necessary to describe the intended audience in the
    text, but keep it in mind when writing the document. Adjust the tone,
    style, and technical level of the text based on the intended audience.
    Do not insult them by saying something is obvious.
   </para>
   <para>
    Aim the document at the reader by describing tasks the reader may need
    to complete rather than the organization of the program. For example,
    when describing YaST, focus on how to configure the devices and services
    the user needs rather than the module structure and available dialogs.
   </para>
   <para>
    Try to focus on the positives: what the program can do rather than its
    limitations. Be honest in your documentation and avoid absolutes and the
    exaggerations of marketing-speak.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.edrules.cap">
   <title>Capitalization</title>
   <para>
    Use title-style capitalization for all types of headings and titles,
    including figure and table titles. This style is explained in
    <citetitle>Chicago</citetitle> 8.167.

    <listitem>
     <para>

   <para>
    In variable lists, capitalize the term in title-style unless it is a
    complete sentence. In all list items, use sentence-style capitalization
    (capitalize the first letter and proper nouns only). Use title-style for
    row and column labels in tables.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.edrules.contract">
   <title>Contractions</title>
   <para>
    SUSE and openSUSE documentation does not normally permit the use of
    contractions. Contractions are only permitted in casual documents and
    texts. A good example of appropriate use of contractions is the SuSE
    tour that was included in older releases. It provided a friendly and
    somewhat humorous introduction to applications and was aimed
    predominantly at the the home user.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.edrules.reference">
   <title>Cross-References and References to External Resources</title>
   <para>
    Use <sgmltag>xref</sgmltag> when you refer to an appendix, chapter,
    part, preface, section, table, figure, or example. The referenced
    element needs an <sgmltag class="attribute">id</sgmltag> attribute. When
    referencing these elements, do not insert a text label like
    <quote>appendix</quote>, <quote>chapter</quote>, <quote>part</quote>,
    <quote>preface</quote>, <quote>section</quote>, <quote>table</quote>,
    <quote>figure</quote>, and <quote>example</quote>. These are inserted
    automatically.
   </para>
   <para>
    Do not insert a reference to a paragraph (<sgmltag>para</sgmltag>). If
    you need a reference to a list, insert <sgmltag>id</sgmltag> and
    <sgmltag>xreflabel</sgmltag>.
   </para>
   <para>
    References to man pages and info pages should generally be made in the
    format <quote>the man page of <command>command</command></quote> or
    <quote>the info page of <command>command</command></quote>. In a
    situation where the category of the page is needed, add
    <quote>(<command>man 9 command</command>)</quote> to the end.
   </para>
   <para>
    Use <sgmltag>ulink</sgmltag> for a URL, like
    <ulink url="http://www.suse.de"/>. Always use the correct protocol
    prefix (http, ftp, mailto) to enable the automated link check. Never use
    <sgmltag>filename</sgmltag> for this kind of link. Anything that should
    show up as a clickable link in the final HTML and PDF docs must bear the
    correct markup. Otherwise you risk breaking the link checking tools and rob
    the user of extra functionality, such as being able to click to reach
    external documents. Do not enter a text label for the <sgmltag>ulink</sgmltag>
    so that the URL itself appears in printed versions.
   </para>
   <para>
    Do not use <sgmltag>ulink</sgmltag> and the <literal>file:</literal>
    prefix to reference filenames. Use <sgmltag>filename</sgmltag> for
    files.
   </para>
   <para>
    Do not use links across documents where ID and IDREF linking is not
    possible and <sgmltag>ulink</sgmltag> is inappropriate. For references
    to information in SUSE books outside the current document set, use the
    appropriate entity for the book title. The reference should not refer to
    a specific chapter or section number or title because these things
    change too easily. Instead, make a reference using the document title
    but no specific headers.
   </para>
   <para>
    Insert references to external (not SUSE or openSUSE) books in the format
    "Title by Author (ISBN #)." Inclusion of the ISBN is optional. Place the
    title in <sgmltag>citetitle</sgmltag> tags. For example:
   </para>
<screen>&lt;citetitle>Indexing Books&lt;/citetitle> by Nancy C. Mulvany
(ISBN 0-226-55014-1) is a useful guide for indexing.</screen>
   <para>
    It is useful to provide language-specific references in the translated
    books. If the authors know of language-specific versions, they can

   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      List environments should be used cautiously. Their markup is quite
      distinct and overusing them might disrupt the text flow.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Always introduce a list in the text. If needed for reference or better
      coordination with the related text, add an optional title and an
      <sgmltag class="attribute">id</sgmltag> attribute.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A list must contain at least two items. If items are short and simple
      in structure, consider incorporating them in the flowing text instead
      of creating a list environment.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Use sentence-style capitalization for the list items. Use title-style
      capitalization for terms in descriptive lists.

    <listitem>
     <para>

      Make sure that the items are grammatically parallel constructions

     </para>

   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    The different types can be nested, but avoid nesting too many levels.
    When nesting different types of lists or introducing multiple levels of
    one type, always consider the flow of the text. It is rarely necessary
    to have more than one level in a list. Using too many levels disrupts
    the text flow, confuses readers, and heavily influences the document
    layout. Consider these issues carefully before nesting lists or
    introducing another list level. Restructuring the information using a
    well-balanced combination of lists and flowing texts may prove a good
    approach.

   steps that are usually performed sequentially. A procedure environment
   consists of the following elements:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     An optional title. If you need to reference the procedure as a whole,
     set an <sgmltag
      class="attribute">id</sgmltag>. The title is then
     used as the label of the reference.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     An introductory phrase establishing the purpose of the procedure. If
     necessary, add the preconditions of the operation.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Steps and substeps describing what the reader must do. If needed, add
     an explanatory paragraph, but keep it short. Do not use only one
     substep in a step or one step in a procedure.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Alternative actions are introduced by a substep environment containing

  <title>Presenting Computer Elements</title>

  <para>
   When documenting software, it is frequently necessary to describe the

   standardized for consistency.
  </para>

  <para>
   Only specify the software component in ambiguous contexts. Only put

   <para>
    Linux commands are case-sensitive, so always present them as they appear

    as part of screen environments or examples. In flowing text, use
    <sgmltag>command</sgmltag> when referring to an actual command you would
    use on a command line:
   </para>
   <literallayout>Use <command>loffice</command> to start LibreOffice from the command line.

   <para>
    In cases where it helps understanding, you should use markup for commands

  <title>Creating an Index</title>

  <para>
   An index is an important part of a book, especially when printing. Index
   terms should be used to provide the reader with access to useful information.
   Insert the term as close to the relevant text as possible to ensure that the
   page reference points to the correct location. When more than a few
   paragraphs contain information that should be indexed under this term,
   use a page range. Page ranges help users determine how much information a
   given section provides on a certain topic. Nest index terms up to
   two levels deep.
  </para>

  <para>
   When indexing, try to answer the question: Is a user likely to be looking
   for this information? For example, a section about
   configuring an application should be indexed to the application, but a
   passing reference to the application should not be indexed at all.
  </para>

  <para>Some parts of a document should never be indexed, those include
   <quote>For More Information</quote> sections, abstracts, or commands that
   only appear as means to a different end (as in, do not index
   <command>cd</command> when it is only used to change directories as part of
   a procedure).
  </para>

  <para>
   Be careful with consistently selecting the terms to index. However, consider
   that users might not have the exact same terms in mind as you do, especially
   when it comes to highly technical words or brands. Write nouns in the plural
   and verbs in a gerund form (<emphasis>-ing</emphasis>).
   Capitalize terms only if they would be capitalized if used in the middle of
   a sentence.
  </para>

  <para>
   When selecting terms, try to consider what else is included in the
   manual. If the manual only includes a small amount of information on a given
   topic, general index items are probably more appropriate. If indexing a
   chapter about an application, much more specific index terms are needed
   so that users can find exactly the information they need.
  </para>

   Finally, a few tips to help <quote>polish</quote> indexes:

  <title>Spelling and Terminology</title>

  <para>
    For all words not specially defined below, SUSE uses American English
    spellings as defined below in <citetitle>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate
    Dictionary, Eleventh Edition</citetitle> or the accompanying web site
    <ulink url="http://www.m-w.com/"/>. However,
    in case of a doubt, the primary spelling in the printed dictionary is
    considered authoritative.

    <title>Finer Points of Spelling</title>

  <title>Terminology</title>

  <para>
    Because multiple spellings of a variety of words and terms are in common
    usage, we have standardized on a variant to use in our documentation.
    Terms in this table are capitalized as they would be in the middle of a
    sentence. Some words listed here are provided because they are often
    written incorrectly by non-native speakers.

    the remark should insert their username, a colon, and comments inside the
    tags but starting on a new line. Comments should be deleted by the original
    writer when they consider the issue resolved. The following is an
    example remark:

        <sgmltag>literal</sgmltag> is specific data taken literally from a
        computer system. It is similar in some ways to
        <sgmltag>userinput</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>computeroutput</sgmltag>,
